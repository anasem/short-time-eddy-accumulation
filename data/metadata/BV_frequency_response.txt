Metadata for file: BV_frequency_response

Simulated buffer volume response modeled as a first order linear filter.
q         : dimensionless flow rate
freq      : frequency [Hz]
magnitude : magnitude of the filter
phase     : phase shift of the filter [degrees]
fc        : cutoff frequency [Hz]
tau       : filter's time constant [seconds]
