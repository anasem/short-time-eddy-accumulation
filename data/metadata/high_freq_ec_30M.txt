Metadata for file: high_freq_ec_30M

High frequency measurements from an IRGA and a sonic anemometer, used for showing how STEA works.
C      : scalar concentration [umol mol^-1]
w      : vertical wind velocity [m sec-1]
time   : UTC timestamp YYYY-mm-ddTh:MM:0SZ
Z      : sampling direction (updraft or downdraft)
J      : Group number
J_up   : grouping factor of equal accumulated mass for updraft
J_down : grouping factor of equal accumulated mass for downdraft
