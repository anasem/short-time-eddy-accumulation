Metadata for file: gas_analyzer_stats_20M

Summary statistics calculated from the raw gas_analyzer_20M. For each short
interval event identified by event_id, the median of raw measurements is
calculated.

aiid       : averaging interval unique identifier
time       : UTC timestamp YYYY-mm-ddTh:MM:0SZ
event_id   : sampling event unique identifier
CH4_dry    : median of measured CH4 concentrations in the sampling event as a dry mole fraction [ppm]
CH4_wet    : median of measured CH4 concentrations in the sampling event as a wet mole fraction [ppm]
CO2_dry    : median of measured CO2 concentrations in the sampling event as a dry mole fraction [ppm]
CO2_wet    : median of measured CO2 concentrations in the sampling event as a wet mole fraction [ppm]
H2O_dry    : median of measured H2O concentrations in the sampling event as a dry mole fraction [ppm]
H2O_wet    : median of measured H2O concentrations in the sampling event as a wet mole fraction [ppm]
is_updraft : is the active buffer volume updraft [boolean]
duration   : duration of the sampling event in seconds
